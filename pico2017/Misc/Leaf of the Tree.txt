So this one is basic terminal commands. You're given a folder, with more folders inside and have to search for the flag. For now it's small enough to check by hand which you can do, or you can be smart.

First do find ./* to list all the stuff in the trunk folder and see what you're working with, and then do find ./* | grep flag to search only for results that have flag in them. You're given the directory, and now you can just cat the file!
