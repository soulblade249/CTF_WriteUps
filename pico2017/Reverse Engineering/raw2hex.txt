I used the command `cut -d ":" -f 2 <<< "$(./raw2hex)" | od -An -t x1` to get the hex of the output. 
`cut -d ":" -f 2 <<< "$(./raw2hex)"` gets the output from raw2hex without the beginning "The flag is:".
It then gets the hex representation of the characters with `od -An -t x1`.
All that I needed to do was to remove the spaces and the final "0A" byte since that was a new line character from the output.
This can be shortened down to `cut -d ":" -f 2 <<< "$(./raw2hex)" | od -An -t x1 | tr -d '[:space:]' | sed "s/..$//g"`, but it looks really ugly and I'm sure there's a better way of writing it.
