Wireshark tells us we're looking at USB data
We can extract the actual data we're looking at with `tshark -r data.pcap -T fields -e usb.capdata | grep -E "^.{23}$" | grep -v 00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00 > data.txt`
Then a python script to get the ascii from that data, based on the pdf linked in the hints.
